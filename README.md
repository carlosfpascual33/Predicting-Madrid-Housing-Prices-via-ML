# Predicting-Madrid-Housing-Prices-via-ML
A project about predicting housing prices in Madrid thorugh machine learning algorithms, namely multivariate linear regression.

Starting from real data from Idealista (a real estate website and app that allows users to buy, sell, or rent properties), the most relevant variables were selected, and machine learning models were applied to predict prices on a test set. A thorough study and interpretation of the dataset was performed, and the resulting models were analyzed in detail, identifying the profiles for most expensive/cheapest properties and providing interpretable conclusions from the predictions.
